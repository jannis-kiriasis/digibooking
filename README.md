## Introduction

[Digibooking repository](https://github.com/jannis-kiriasis/digibooking)

Digibooking is a digital marketing agency offering services to hotels and B&Bs.

![Digibooking responsive design](./README-files/ami-responsivedesign.is.png)

There is a good demand worldwide for hotel, B&B and rental businesses marketing. 

Just look at Google Ads keyword planner data. In the UK only there are 1k monthly searches for “hotel marketing agency”. This doesn’t include variation of the keyphrase and keywords for associated services such as “hotel seo services” or “hotel digital marketing agency”.

Google “Hotel marketing agency” and you’ll find million of results. Literally.

In the past, tourists used to explore and book their holidays by going to physical travel agents. 

Today, travellers book online on the many Online Travel Agents (OTAs) available (booking.com, hotels.com etc).

Hotel managers had to learn how to use OTAs, generate online direct bookings and manage all the digital marketing channels to remain competitive.

Nowadays, being online isn’t enough. 

Some hotels hire entire digital marketing teams, others, outsource digital marketing services from agencies.

Digibooking.com specialise in digital marketing services for hotels to grow their online bookings from Google Search.

## Issues fixed

1. Fit 2 columns with width 50% and margin on the same row. The total width + margin is above 100%. Solution: use box-sizing:border-box and the margin width is included in the column width.
2. Make the button left and right sides completely rounded. Setting a border-radius: 50% will make my button completely rounder. Solution: Set the border-radius to the same dimension as the left and right padding.
3. Center align horizontally 4 images in a div. Solution: used display: flex and justify-content: center; [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10989238/center-image-horizontally-within-a-div)
4. Make search-services-white and search-services-light-blue grow with their content. Solution: Add overflow:hidden to parent container [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4657148/how-to-make-a-div-grow-with-content)

The website has also been tested for rensiveness on ami.responsivedesign.is with the following results:
- [index.html](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=https://jannis-kiriasis.github.io/digibooking/index.html)
- [services.html](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=https://jannis-kiriasis.github.io/digibooking/services.html)
- [contact.html](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=https://jannis-kiriasis.github.io/digibooking/contact.html)

### Lighthouse testing
Overall, the lighthouse report is very positive. 

![Lighthouse report](./README-files/lighthouse-report.png)\
[Lighthouse report](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?psiurl=https%3A%2F%2Fjannis-kiriasis.github.io%2Fdigibooking%2Findex.html&strategy=mobile&category=performance&category=accessibility&category=best-practices&category=seo&category=pwa&utm_source=lh-chrome-ext)

Performance on mobile devices can be further optimised by reducing the Largest Contentful Paint and the First Contentful Paint.

- The FCP can be optimised by reducing the number of Critical Request Chains: Not using Fontawesome and Google Fonts is a solution to further improve the performance score.

- The LCP can be optimised by using a CDN to serve images (the hero images are the LCP) or by removing the hero images from mobile hero banners.

### User stories testing

I've tested whether the user needs have been satisfied with the features created.

## Deployement

I've deployed the website on GitHub Pages. The website was developed on Gitpod and pushed to its GitHub repository usying git command lines in the terminal. Everytime a commit pushed to the website's repository updates the html and css files, GitHub Pages automatically updates the live demo.
To deploy the website:
1. from the GitHub repository, click on 'settings'
2. find and click on pages on the setting sidebar menu
3. selecte the branch to be used. In this case 'main'
4. Refresh the page and in few minutes, the following message will appear if the website was deployed correctly
![website published](./README-files/website-published.png)

To run the website locally, use your preferred text editor and paste `git clone https://github.com/jannis-kiriasis/digibooking.git` into your terminal. To find more cloning options click on the 'code' dropdown in the [digibooking repository](https://github.com/jannis-kiriasis/digibooking/).
