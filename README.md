# Project 1 - Digibooking

## Introduction

[Digibooking.com](https://jannis-kiriasis.github.io/digibooking/) is a digital marketing agency offering services to hotels and B&Bs.

There is a good demand worldwide for hotel, B&B and rental businesses marketing. 

Just look at Google Ads keyword planner data. In the UK only there are 1k monthly searches for “hotel marketing agency”. This doesn’t include variation of the keyphrase and keywords for associated services such as “hotel seo services” or “hotel digital marketing agency”.

Google “Hotel marketing agency” and you’ll find million of results. Literally.

In the past, tourists used to explore and book their holidays by going to physical travel agents. 

Today, travellers book online on the many Online Travel Agents (OTAs) available (booking.com, hotels.com etc).

Hotel managers had to learn how to use OTAs, generate online direct bookings and manage all the digital marketing channels to remain competitive.

Nowadays, being online isn’t enough. 

Some hotels hire entire digital marketing teams, others, outsource digital marketing services from agencies.

Digibooking.com specialise in digital marketing services for hotels to grow their online bookings from Google Search.

## Issues fixed

1. Fit 2 columns with width 50% and margin on the same row. The total width + margin is above 100%. Solution: use box-sizing:border-box and the margin width is included in the column width.
2. Make the button left and right sides completely rounded. Setting a border-radius: 50% will make my button completely rounder. Solution: Set the border-radius to the same dimension as the left and right padding.
3. Center align horizontally 4 images in a div. Solution: used display: flex and justify-content: center; [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10989238/center-image-horizontally-within-a-div)
4. Make search-services-white and search-services-light-blue grow with their content. Solution: Add overflow:hidden to parent container [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4657148/how-to-make-a-div-grow-with-content)
